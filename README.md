# Data Engineering Pipeline - OnPremise
test
## Introduction

This project simulates a production-grade data engineering pipeline that automates the extraction of operational data from an OLTP database, to deliver cleaned datasets in a Delta Lake environment. The pipeline is built using modern Big Data applications, containerized to replicate enterprise-level data workflows without OS compatibility issues.

This project is designed for educational and skill demonstration purposes.

## Datasets Used
![dataset1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/309bd941-b8a0-40a0-ac6c-243f393cd3e7)

The source system is a MySQL database that represents a simulated business data model. While all data is fictitious, the schema and relationships are designed to mimic real-world scenarios with logical consistency across tables.
